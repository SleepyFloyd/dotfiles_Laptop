" Purpose:  This is a configuration file for Vimperator. Vimperator is a free
"           browser add-on for Firefox, which makes it look and behave like
"           the Vim text editor.
"
" Version:  This file was used and written for the Vimperator 0.5.3
"
" Notes:    First of all this are the settings that I use! You HAVE TO EDIT
"           some things e. g. the bookmark and key mappings at the end of the
"           file, or the defsearch settings. It should be easy to change them,
"           because every setting is well documented.
"       
"           If you never used Vi or Vim you should first learn to use one of
"           these editors, before you use Vimperator
"
" Structure:
"           There are three^W two kinds of things which are defined in this
"           file: settings ("set") and mappings ("map").
"               - Settings affect the behaviour of commands.
"               - Mappings maps a key sequence to a command.
"               - There are no abbreviations because it's a BROWSER! not vim :)
"
"           The settings are sorted alphabetically to make it easier to access
"           a specific item and basically the simplest way to sort data :-) I
"           think I mentioned all possible settings, if i miss something,
"           please mail me.
"
"           Every setting has a short and a long name. It doesn't matter which
"           one you use for the sake of completeness both are documented.  For
"           example:
"       ,------
"       |   |'activate'| define when tabs are automatically activated strin-
"       |                glist (default: homepage,quickmark,tabopen,paste)
"       |    set act=homepage,quickmark,tabopen,paste
"       `------
"           This time is the long name set in |' '| and the short is used in
"           the set command. 
"
"           Settings which you only can turn on or off (boolean) are unset
"           with an no Prefix. For example:
"       ,------
"       |   |'hlsearch'| Highlight previous search pattern matches
"       |   set nohlsearch
"       `------
"           Or of couse you can use the negated short form
"       ,------
"       |   set nohls
"       `------
"           If I commented out a setting, than the default values are listed
"           and of course used.
"
"           Lines starting with an inverted comma (") are comments.
"           Vimperator allows to give special characters by writing them in a
"           special notation.  The notation encloses descriptive words in
"           angle brackets
"           (<>). The most common characters are:
"               - <C-M> for control-m
"               - <C-V> for control-v which quotes the following character
"               - <ESC> for the escape character.
"               - <Fn>  for F1, F2, ..
"               - <C-n> for control-n (i. e. strg-a, strg-k, ..)
"               - <Space> for space :)
" 
" 
" Warning:  To provide the most authentic Vim experience, the Firefox menubar
"           and toolbar were hidden. If you really need them, type :set
"           guioptions+=mT to get them back. If you don't like Vimperator at
"           all, type :addons and remove/disable it. If you like it, but can't
"           remember the shortcuts, enter :help to get the help window.  (I
"           have disabled the F1 shortcut)
